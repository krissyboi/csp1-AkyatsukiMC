					<h1 id="nobela" class="animated fadeInLeft delay-1s"> About Us </h1>
					<p id="nobela" class="animated fadeInRight delay-1s text-justify">First of all, we are a group of friends. That’s why public figure ang makikita nyo sa page namin (wala kasing friendship sa pagpipilian). We are a group of people who loves hiking, exploring, camping, traveling, eating and even drinking to the max (minsan lang naman).
						I met them through hiking, and eventually we became friends. Barkada na sobrang ganda, weekly/monthly meron na kaming akyat. That’s why we became “suki ng mga akyatan”, later termed as “Akyatsuki”, at dahil na rin mahilig kami sa Naruto. We organize private events, kami kami lang talaga. 4-6 lang kami, all of them DIY/KKB events. Sobrang gastos. Napapamahal kami pero ayos lang, enjoy naman. Other than us, no one will know kung anong aakyatin namin, kasi nga private, laging ninja events. Malalaman na lang nila later on, pag nag post na kami ng pictures and videos ng naging adventure namin.
						From the moment we step our foot on these kinds of adventure, we already know the risk, and the 6 of us is willing to sacrifice… jk. It’s becoming too dramatic. But on a serious note, 6 of us know the risk and we are willing to take it just to satisfy our passions. We do not just climb. We follow rules. We have our own principles. We set expectations. We embrace the air and the culture. We respect everyone. We focus more on the safety as a group. Other than that,

					<p id="nobela" class="animated fadeInRight delay-2s text-justify"> we do not spam events on the same mountain or location over and over again (we have videos as a proof). Parang yung Al Capone lang sa J.CO, inulit ulit kong kainin, yung tipong every day, eventually nagsawa din agad ako.	1 hiking event became 5, grows into 10, so on and so forth. Our friends became curious, sending us message saying that they are interested on our adventures and wants to join because it looks fun. They can see it on our pictures and videos, not only the beauty of nature, but also how fun our group was.our planned events grew bigger, but still private and DIY/KKB. As our group grew bigger, the enjoyment and passion follows. Bukod dun, yung hatian sa guide ay mas bumaba.
						The group developed into something. We learn things. We became more mature, but the risk is still there.
						Asides from hiking, we have normal jobs like everyone else, we work our ass off just to live and pay bills. Our only escape is this and nothing can take it away from us (maybe quadriplegia or hemiplegia). We want to climb mountains that we do not climb before. We want to travel on a tight budget because we are so fucking poor but we love to travel. Why? We feel alive when we travel! We can escape our normal lives even for a day or 8 hours. Alam nyo yun mga bes, nasa normal na trabaho ka, hindi nga delikado pero yung feeling na parang ayaw na ayaw mo na magtrabaho at parang pinapatay ka na sa work mo kaso wala kang magawa kasi kailangan. Exaggerated man pero may ganung mga instances. Unlike sa hiking, na delikado, mas masarap sa pakiramdam. Nakakagaan.
						I’m getting side tracked, anyways, so we plan things just to lessen our expenses when hiking. That’s why we began creating public events. We just have to put more efforts on our research like we usually do. Another fresh duty of the group is to find a trusted driver and van, fortunately, we have him now.
						We climb now as a group of 15 in 1 van. Thus, lessening the expense of every participant, and that includes us. 3-4/6 of core members of the group is always in the event. 2 core with 1 guide as a sweeper, 1 core in the middle, and 1 core with 1 guide as a lead. We have a nurse on our group who knows first aid, CPR, or basic life support. Yes, we are knowledgeable enough as a hiker but we are telling you that we are not a legitimate business; we only create events that we know everyone can benefit from. As a matter of fact, we are also paying the event fee we are setting. But the question is, “kumikita parin kayo eh!” lol, yes, totoo yan. Pero fair naman siguro yun dahil sa effort ng group at sa pa event video ni mayor. Pati kada event, ilang organizer kami lagi na kasama, divide mo yun sa profit. Kahit ganun lang kaliit yung profit, masaya parin kami. Pero saan napupunta? Gumawa kami ng sariling bank account ng grupo. Pambili ng gamit as a group yun. We trust each other so much and we lab eats ader.
						We can’t offer you insurance. We can only offer 100% effort for the event. We hike at our own risk like you do. Most of our friends join us on our event; some participants we do not fully know but later on became our friends. They know the risk like we do. Like us, you also have a choice to join our events. Di naman kami namimilit. We can do it again as a private thing, It’s not like we can’t go back, but we enjoy the bigger circle, at syempre mas tipid. Gaya nga ng sabi ko, nasa participants parin ang final decision kung sasama ba sila samin. Gusto ko lang emphasize na wala kaming insurance. Yun lang naman.
					You can call us business if you want. I call it friendship with benefits. Lol. Sorry for the long post.
